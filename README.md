We offer this free checker to anyone in our community and have decided to release it in the public on GitHub!

Requirements:
- Python 3.10/3.11
- Some Python packages like requests, bs4, uuid. (We will provide an requirements.txt)
- Windows 10/11
- Proxies IP:Port (IPRoyal, Webshare, Proxyscrape, pretty much any provider with IP:Port)

Setup Guide:
- Install Python 3.10/3.11
- Download Loader
- Join our Discord to get an key and Solver username/password 
- Enter the key, the loader will now create the Files/Folders it requires. The loader will close
- Load your proxies in proxies.txt
- Load your combo's in Combo's folder
- Ready to go, choose threads on start and let's go!

If you got any issues with the setup, feel free to contact us. Also in our Discord we have an Launcher, which makes sure you always use the latest build 
(We update every now and then for improvements, this is due to us having our own Captcha Service which sometimes requires patches to the checker!)
Just reach out to us by joining our Discord, verify yourself and open a ticket in #support (We don't track IP, we use GuildMergers so we only see Discord ID and that's it)
